# Object-Detection-
# Geeks Object Detection using OpenCV in Python.

OpenCV dnn module supports running inference on pre-trained deep learning models from popular frameworks like YOLO, TensorFlow, etc.<br><br>
This project implements image Object detection, video Object detection and Real Time video Object detection through webcam using YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm.<br>
For this project pretrained YOLOv3 models was used. The YOLOv3 implementation is from [darknet](https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet).

## Important Modules Needed
#### 1. opencv-python:
    Pre-built CPU-only OpenCV packages for Python.
#### 2. numpy:
    NumPy can be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data. Arbitrary data-types can be defined
#### 3. argparse:
    The argparse module makes it easy to write user friendly command line interfaces.

<br>
I've used YOLO v3 for coding purpose in this repository.<br>
<b>YOLO (You Only Look Once)</b> is a very powerful and a fast algorithm in object detection. A strong understanding of the algorithm is essential before we start to code.<br>

### Before getting started, Make sure you have numpy and opencv installed. If not install them using pip.
     pip install numpy
     pip install opencv-python
